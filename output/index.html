                <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The necessary safety precautions necessitated by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) has drastically affected the day-to-day lives of the over 112 thousand law students currently enrolled at ABA-approved law schools <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#a586bfbc758c4df482b41bee4d895684">[1]</a>. </p>
<p>While this transition is disruptive on so many levels across the legal education system, the  inherent inequities associated with this sudden change require immediate attention and unprecedented action. One such action is to shift to a <strong>mandatory</strong> "Pass/Fail" grading system for all law students during their Spring semesters <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#26940e09a45847a383ae96ab8f71dae8">[2]</a>. </p>
<h2>A quick aside</h2>
<p>I fully recognize and appreciate that the very fact that I am <em>in</em> law school is an extraordinary privilege afforded to few, and that the "big picture" associated with this outbreak extends far beyond the concerns of law students, law schools, and the legal profession.  I also want to offer a disclaimer - I personally <em>prefer</em> working from home. I have an introverted personality and I really enjoy the work space and environment that my wife and I have set up in our home. That being said, I recognize that my circumstances are more the exception than the rule.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I also would like to note that these views are my own and they do not necessarily reflect the views of my school, the faculty that I've learned from and worked with, or my peers. </p>
<h1>Inequities of the "catastrophically online" law school</h1>
<p>The anonymous essay grading system and mandatory class curve at many schools serve an egalitarian purpose: to give every student an equal opportunity to learn the law and apply that law to facts. While there's certainly reasoned arguments in support of or against this grading system, those concerns pale in comparison to the fundamental inequity that arises out of our new temporary reality. </p>
<h2>Technical inequity</h2>
<p>The most apparent and straightforward dimension of inequity comes from the differing levels of technical equipment and comfort with shifting the sum total of one's educational experience into a screen no larger than their textbooks. </p>
<p>For example, let's take a laptop for the Class of 2021. A mid 2017 MacBook Air (released in June 2017 and was the latest MacBook Air model available to students starting in August 2018) came standard with a 1.8 GHz processor <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#5702c864c664461bb4a4de5245dd14aa">[3]</a>.  Zoom, a leading web conferencing software suite, <strong>recommends</strong> that users have at <em>least</em> a 2GHz processor <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#7bcc0cb45cdf4b37bbaecacf4fc4fe8b">[4]</a>. While Zoom's <em>minimum</em> requirements specify a 1GHz processor, the typical use case for a student in an online lecture requires that student to have multiple applications running concurrently in addition to their web conference tool, such as a word processor to review an outline, a note taking application to take class notes, and an e-textbook or PDF reader. </p>
<p>Students with lower-end devices are thus saddled with a user experience that just slows them down. Compare that "low end hardware" student to another student that has the resources to invest in a higher end computer, a widescreen monitor, an external full-size keyboard, and mouse. </p>
<p>The differences may not be apparent at first, but as hours and hours of online instruction add up (combined with hours and hours of reading), the advantage of a fast machine in an ergonomically sound configuration becomes more and more apparent. Companies like Google recognize the importance of hardware when working at home and have given employees work from home "kits" for employees that come standard with monitors, keyboards, and mice <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#dbda943d9ce344c89eb17513d57f24d7">[5]</a>. While I of course am not asking schools to offer the same amenities to students as a multibillion dollar corporation, I <em>am</em> asking that these schools consider the difference that the right set-up can make. </p>
<p>Another dimension of technical inequity comes in the form of access to broadband internet. While broadband penetration today is better than ever, the availability of and access to high speed internet that is capable of streaming full motion video and high quality audio is less certain, particularly given the current climate where local network providers are going to dealing with significant network congestion as a result of basically <em>every</em> knowledge worker working from home. I've seen it myself in a few classes already, where students have dropped in and out of classes due to local internet issues. </p>
<h2>Logistical inequity</h2>
<p>Beyond the technical issues, there are also remains the fundamental problem of <em>finding a quiet place to do work</em>. Law students have a close relationship to their libraries, often because of the fact that the library represents one of the few spaces in a student's life that is actually <em>quiet</em>. In a time where we're encouraged to practice social distancing in public settings, finding a place to sit quietly for hours on end (and, for that matter, occasionally interact with classmates and professors online) is <em>really hard</em>. Not every student has the benefits of a childhood bedroom or home office, particularly those students that come from lower income backgrounds or from families with multiple adult children now occupying the same space. </p>
<p>There's also the problem of accessing textbooks, research materials, and printers. There's a reason why my school gives law students a generous printing allowance - we use a <em>lot</em> of paper. The ability to thumb through books, outlines, and articles often helps us engage with the material and organize our work - something that might not be possible even <em>with</em> a high capacity printer at home because our kitchen tables can only function as "document dumps" for so long. </p>
<p>The final point about logistical inequity is a simple one: time. By moving classrooms to the home, law schools have foisted upon some students the responsibility for maintaining both their living <em>and</em> working spaces. This requires time - time to clean the space with more regularity, time to rearrange furniture between modes of use, and time to <em>get out</em> of the space in order to refresh our minds and bodies. </p>
<h2>Emotional inequity</h2>
<p>The last and in my opinion most troubling type of inequity comes from the different ways law students have had to bear the emotional weight of this pandemic. As these weeks roll on, law students across the country will deal with stresses arising out of differing levels of local outbreak containment efforts, economic impacts, and family tragedies. </p>
<p>While schools have made strides in identifying and mitigating sources of stress amongst law students, the unique recipe of career uncertainty, "all-or-nothing" grading, and looming financial obligations mixes into a sour blend that is already hard to swallow. This pandemic and the necessary mitigations associated with it have made what was once indigestible now absolutely toxic. </p>
<p>Among the "run of the mill" stresses weighing law students down, they now have to deal with: </p>
<ul>
<li>Physically isolating themselves from their friends and study groups and limiting social interaction to screens.</li>
<li>Completely upending established routines and methods of studying.</li>
<li>An uncertain economic future, particularly for those who will be leaving their schools at the end of the semester.</li>
<li>The ever-present threat that someone close to us will be fatally affected by the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, every student in these online schools of law will continue to be confronted by the press coverage of and social media reactions to the outbreak. It's absolutely inescapable, particularly when these channels often are the <em>only</em> mechanism that students have to participate in the world around them. A student's social networks are as diverse as they are, and there is frankly no way to predict or control what information is made available to them absent requiring students to completely disconnect from the outside world. </p>
<p>Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention the scores of students in clinics or externship programs that have been forced to abandon their clients as part of this transition. While advisors, mentors, and clinical attorneys of course will do everything in their power to maintain connections and continue representations, the lingering guilt of feeling that you <em>abandoned your client</em> can't be understated. </p>
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>With the above points in mind, I strongly suggest that law schools act in the best interests of current law students and adopt a mandatory "pass/fail" grading system and to announce that change to their student body as soon as possible. </p>
<h2>Why make it mandatory?</h2>
<p>Many schools have considered or implemented a system where students can <em>choose</em> to complete their semesters with traditional letter grades or with a pass/fail system. </p>
<p>I am against this for one simple reason: the stigma attached to a pass/fail credit when students have an option between pass/fail grading and letter grading. While I do not have a view into the legal hiring system beyond my own personal experiences, I do not think there is any doubt that grades matter and will <em>continue</em> to matter after this pandemic subsides. Accordingly, the first thought in any student's mind (particularly in those in the class of 2022) will be - how would this look on my transcript? Forcing a student to choose between the <em>possibility</em> of an "A" and the (almost) <em>certainty</em> of a "Pass" in a time like this adds yet another unnecessary layer of burdensome complexity in an already uncertain time. </p>
<h3>What about the students that have worked to improve their grades?</h3>
<p>This is the most common justification that I've seen for an optional pass/fail system. Students rightfully feel that they are entitled to an opportunity to improve their grades after underperforming, and a pass/fail system deprives those students of the opportunity to demonstrate upward momentum and thus make themselves more appealing to prospective employers. I regret that I don't have a clean solution for this, but I do have a few suggestions: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look at the data:</strong> I encourage law schools to go back through their grade histories and understand how many students have been able to boost their grades after underperforming. At a minimum, this will help better approximate the impact that this type of system would have. </li>
<li><strong>Split the schedule:</strong>  Given that grades represent a big concern for hiring season and OCI, law schools should work with hiring firms to "split" their hiring across the fall and spring semesters for 2020-2021 academic year. This way, students that performed well in their first semester can bid and interview with their best foot forward (as high performing students end up doing during their 1L spring after performing well during their 1L fall), and students that want an opportunity to improve can do so during their 2L/3L fall semesters. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Why not let the professors decide how they want to grade?</h2>
<p>While I do not doubt the capacity for compassion that professors have in a time like this, leaving the choice of grading in the hands of individual professors still creates uncertainty in the system and blunts the benefits associated with a clearly communicated, universal plan. Moreover, if we're trying to adapt against inequity, creating even more variability is <em>not</em> the best way forward. </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As part of their efforts to support employees during this pandemic, Facebook recently announced that they will be giving every single employee the same "exceeds expectations" performance review for the first half of the year, a fact that underscores the impact of this pandemic and the importance of setting new norms in times of crisis <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#ff1dc0f700374472867ac95159a3f249">[6]</a>. </p>
<p>Among all of the lessons that this sprint from offline to online education will teach us in the coming weeks, one early insight comes through: leadership matters. The first schools to switch to online education set the standard for others to follow, and the law schools that recognize the changing times and adapt in the best interests of their students again have an opportunity to lead by example. </p>
