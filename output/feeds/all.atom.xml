&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, there was one thing that motivated this entire adventure. Our home has a set of lights on the porch that need to get turned on every night. After a few weeks of manually turning them on (or forgetting to turn them off once day breaks), I broke down and decided that I would find a solution. Not content with a simple programmable timer, I wanted something that would turn the lights on at sunset and off at sunrise - without having to reprogram it every few months to account for seasonal changes. This was all the justification I needed to dig into home automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I did before even starting along this journey was understand the &lt;em&gt;basics&lt;/em&gt; of how the various pieces of equipment work inside my home. For this, I leaned heavily on Charlie Wing's book, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2XSvrRq"&gt;How Your House Works - A Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;. The book provides a bunch of easy to interpret diagrams that clearly lay out how different components work - such as plumbing systems, light switches, HVAC, and even individual appliances like dishwashers, garbage disposals, and vacuum cleaners. While most people probably don't need such a rudimentary overview of all these things, I find it essential as a first-time home owner with very few "handy" skills. Most importantly, Wing lays out everything and makes no assumptions about existing knowledge - something that I found &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/wing-book-sample.png" class="img-responsive" alt="A Sample image from Charlie Wing's book depicting a diagram of a circuit breaker box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the diagrams from Wing's book (plus a few other youtube tutorials on the topic) I quickly got up to speed on the basic electrical system in our house - including spending &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; too much time trying to demystify &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching"&gt;3 and 4 way switch&lt;/a&gt; combinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when working with &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; related to electrical systems, if you're at all uncomfortable with it - call your local electrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware for the installation, here's what I used: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3oTv3Nn"&gt;Battery powered screwdriver&lt;/a&gt;, to deal with electrical boxes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cMhE7x"&gt;Non-contact voltage tester&lt;/a&gt;, to make sure that there was to current running through anything I was working on &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YUa6qY"&gt;Wire stripper&lt;/a&gt;, to strip, cut, and bend wires when needed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2N36L6w"&gt;Wire nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to connect wires together &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YP7xGM"&gt;Romex indoor electrical wire&lt;/a&gt;. I purchased a roll of the wire so that I could have a lot of extra wire available to me in the event that I needed to run an extra neutral wire or something like that. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3aKhTx4"&gt;Head lamp&lt;/a&gt;. When you turn power off at the breaker, you're also likely to lose any of the light in the room so a head lamp is a necessity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smart Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a smart home doesn't work without smart components, and I decided to have the majority of the components on a local Z-wave based network. I picked Z-wave for a few reasons, but the biggest one was that I didn't want to have my smart home peripherals reliant on a potentially spotty wifi network. Additionally, one of the big advantages I saw with Z-wave was that each Z-wave device functions as a repeater within the overall network, so a flipped switch on the top floor has an easy path to the home server in the basement. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, however, have to resort to wifi when looking for smart light bulbs. I ultimately resorted to buying 6 &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tAxgRy"&gt;TP-Link KL130 RGB Bulbs&lt;/a&gt; when they were on sale. The bulbs actually work really well and adding colored lighting to a space really does wonders for atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tsvUYS"&gt;Inovelli 3-way Z-wave rocker switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tyeWbv"&gt;Zooz 3-way Z-wave toggle switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3aDwAlL"&gt;Zooz Z-wave smart plug&lt;/a&gt;, which is connected to a bedroom fan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Inovelli and Zooz, I would personally pick Zooz as a smart switch brand to beat. While both the Inovelli and Zooz switches were easy to configure, the Inovelli switch appeared to have way more configuration options (e.g. customizing the LED color on the switch) that in my opinion didn't justify the price delta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to elaborate too much on installing the switches since there are way better tutorials out there, particularly on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXRqaDX7A3A"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Home Server Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "brains" behind the smart home operation is our humble home server, a 2019 Macbook Pro running Ubuntu in place of the original MacOS. Honestly, the big reason I went for Ubuntu was the fact that it I wanted to learn more about running a computer entirely through the command line. The server is connected to our home network using a USB-C to ethernet adapter, and it is also connected to a &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YURyXE"&gt;Zooz USB Z-wave stick&lt;/a&gt; that communicates with the local Z-wave network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the home automation setup we have at home is &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. I went with Home Assistant for the same reason I installed Ubuntu on the Macbook for the home server - I wanted to tinker! At the same time, I also wanted to learn a bit more about &lt;a href="docker.com"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to run Home Assistant within a Docker container alongside a few other home server applications. Here is a crudely drawn sketch of the overall setup: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/homeassistant-docker-layout.png" class="img-responsive" alt="A crudely drawn image of my software setup"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the software set up, I followed the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, it was mostly plug and play. The big issues I had were making sure that the external devices going into the server were passed through to the Home Assistant container. I found &lt;a href="https://jackstromberg.com/2020/02/home-assistant-z-wave-docker-raspberrypi/"&gt;Jack Stromberg's tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on the subject to be very helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial set up, I had to individually link each of the Z-wave switches to the system. This actually was extremely easy thanks to the Home Assistant mobile app, which allowed me to effortlessly add Z-wave nodes incrementally as I moved my way up from the switches closest to the server to the switches on the third floor of the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to running Home Asssitant, I also added a container for &lt;a href="https://jellyfin.org/"&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;, our media server, and &lt;a href="https://www.duplicati.com/"&gt;Duplicati&lt;/a&gt;, which regularly backs up all of the Home Assistant configuration files/keys, encrypts them, and backs them up to a cloud drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, right now I have Home Assistant controlling a few light switches and colored bulbs, but I have some ideas for what I want to do with the system in the coming months: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flashing bulbs/lights when someone approaches the front door &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humidity/temperature sensors that alert us when there's a potential leak or heater being left on &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion activated lights that slowly dim on and off when people walk within certain rooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really excited to keep mucking around with this - it's been quite the education! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="home automation"></category><category term="home automation"></category><category term="home assistant"></category><category term="docker"></category></entry><entry><title>My concerns with an online Bar exam administration</title><link href="/my-concerns-with-an-online-bar-exam-administration.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-12T21:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-07-12T21:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2020-07-12:/my-concerns-with-an-online-bar-exam-administration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a typical summer, recent JDs around the United States would be spending most of May, June, and July studying for the most consequential assessment of their careers - the bar exam.

The two-day test, which surveys multiple areas of state and federal law, represents the final barrier to becoming licensed attorneys that have the ability to put their years of legal education to use in order to serve clients. Every July, hundreds of newly minted law graduates hunch over their laptops in convention center meeting rooms to answer multiple choice questions, fill out essays, and test their abilities to apply law to fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the summer of 2020 has been anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; typical. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only fundamentally changed the way the law is taught, it has also affected the way its tested.  Across the country, state bar examiners have taken different approaches to the problem. Some states have &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/03/27/fall-bar-exam-added-fate-of-july-test-uncertain-amid-covid-19-pandemic-389-99573/"&gt;postponed the exam&lt;/a&gt; to the fall, others have decided to throw caution to the wind and push ahead with the exam as scheduled (with COVID-19 liability &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/liability-waivers-may-not-mean-much-but-two-states-include-them-for-july-in-person-bar-exam"&gt;waivers&lt;/a&gt;, of course), and a growing number of states have recognized the 'once-in-a-lifetime' nature of this event and have &lt;a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/oregon-adopts-diploma-privilege/"&gt;granted emergency diploma privilege&lt;/a&gt; to allow qualified JDs the ability to practice without taking a bar exam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of states, however, have decided to find a "middle ground" in the form of an &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; bar exam, where applicants would use their laptops to take the test wherever they can. While this is often marketed as a "best of all worlds" approach; it is not without significant issues - specifically those of unequal circumstances, technical issues, and privacy risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unequal Circumstances&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems faced by the countless law students forced online during the pandemic as a result of stay at home orders around the country are only magnified by an online bar administration. This includes the foundational task of merely &lt;em&gt;preparing&lt;/em&gt; for the bar. Since many exams are postponed until the Fall, JDs coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds who have carefully budgeted to take the exam in July are now met with the unfortunate reality of finding ways to make ends meet (and potentially put themselves at risk of infection) in order to maintain living expenses until it's time to take the exam.  Some legal employers have even pushed employee start dates to 2021 or rescinded employment offers entirely, adding to the financial uncertainty in the face of rising expenses and student loans. Oh, and registering for &lt;em&gt;one administration&lt;/em&gt; of the bar exam &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is non-refundable and costs nearly $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these candidates have financial flexibility that affords them the ability to study on a full-time basis for the test, that doesn't change the reality of being entirely at home during the summer. We are currently on track for one of the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2020-on-track-to-rank-in-the-top-5-hottest-years-on-record/"&gt;hottest years&lt;/a&gt; on record, and many examinees are simply unable afford or add air conditiong to their homes so that they can study or take the test in a climate controlled environment. This will invariably lead to an unequal test administration, as cognitive performance (including attention, memory, and executive functions) is &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00010.2015"&gt;negatively affected by heat stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond climate issues, there are additional environmental issues.  With &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; staying at home, summer days have shifted from time spent congregating in parks, at the beach, or in public spaces, to full days indoors. While this isn't much of a problem for examinees who happen to live with families in large homes in suburban communities, the JDs that happen to live in densley packed apartments or in condominum complexes have to study while the sounds of neighbors arguing, children scurrying around, and general city life fill their workspaces and function to distract and decrease &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918653/"&gt;inefficiency in attention based tasks&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar exam takers that were in these circumstances after law school &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to have other options - they could return to their campuses to study in quiet spaces, they could vary their routine by visiting local coffee shops, or even catch up on studying in climate controlled public areas like malls, train stations, and libraries - all places that are now (appropriately) unsuitable due to the pandemic. The reality is that not every candidate can follow Harvard Law School's advice to &lt;a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/harvard-law-tells-concerned-students-to-rent-office-space-to-study-during-online-only-semester/"&gt;take out additional loans in order to rent office space&lt;/a&gt; (yes, that was an actual suggestion offered by a member of the school's administration). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a remote examination, a student's ability to prepare and take the exam is contingent on their or their family's ability to afford peace and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Technical Difficulties&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who worked in the software industry as a developer and product manager before going to law school, I can attest to the applicability of Murphy's law in techology. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and tracing the issue is an entire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance_analyst"&gt;career&lt;/a&gt; in itself. Just this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/15/us/ap-exam-glitch-trnd/index.html"&gt;remote administration of AP exams&lt;/a&gt; ended up suffering from technology problems that forced students to either forfeit or take a new exam on the same subject. These problems of course exist during "in-person" bar exam administrations, but those administrations have the added benefit of IT support staff on call as &lt;em&gt;well as&lt;/em&gt; an option for exam takers to hand-write their responses in the event of catastrophe. As of this writing, there has been no information as to whether a hand-written option would be available to remote bar exam takers, and I highly doubt this is even on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was lucky enough to use the exam adminstration software used by many bar exam administratiors (Examplify by ExamSoft) during my own law school experience without any problems, I can confidently attest that for every exam that I took that had more than 20 people in the room, at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; person in the room experienced a software or hardware crash that ncessitated a switch to handwriting. I don't say this to knock ExamSoft specifically, as it's just a reality - computers are not uniformly reliable, and when an exam is as consequential as the bar, there needs to be a safety net. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is going to happen when someone's computer fails during the bar exam? Is there going to be a dedicated phone support line? What will happen to that candidate's scores? Will they have to spend nearly $1000 in fees to register for a new exam? What is to stop a bad actor from purposefully engineering a hardware failure (or simply cutting the power to their computer) when they realize that the exam isn't going the way they hoped it would go? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems are also compounded by issues of internet connectivity. With &lt;a href="https://www.fing.com/news/internet-outage-trends-during-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;internet outages increasing&lt;/a&gt; due to capacity issues caused by an increasingly online working population, bar exam takers are effectively placing their futures in the hands of internet service providers. Comcast, for example, experienced &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/comcast-xfinity/archive/2020/06/"&gt;26 instances of problems or outages&lt;/a&gt; during the month of June alone. Of course, a vendor like ExamSoft will argue that a stable internet connection is not required for the duration of the exam, just the downloading of questions and uploading of answers, but without a generous "grace period" given to all exam takers who end up experiencing outages that could last for hours and hours, internet connectivity will be an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of sending every single test taker a preconfigured "loaner" laptop &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to take the exam (and even that will invariably have problems), I highly doubt that a remote administration of the bar exam will be without significant technical issues for a good portion of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edit - 07/13/20 - Algorithmic unfairness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my law school classmates, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliahlna?lang=en"&gt;Julia Schur&lt;/a&gt;, mentioned this to me that I completely forgot to include in my original upload. If ExamSoft is going to be using their machine learning platform to detect cheating, do we have any insight as to whether they have trained their models on a diverse pool of candidates? I'm hoping that ExamSoft has developed a mechanism to demonstrate that their cheating detection algorithms don't disproportionally affect BIPOC individuals. &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-discussion-on-algorithmic-fairness-740bbb469b6"&gt;More information on algorithmic unfairness here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Privacy Concerns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the remote exam administration is conducted by ExamSoft using their remote examination tools, there are also significant privacy concerns that need to be addressed. ExamSoft's distributed assessment product, ExamMonitor, is marketed as a method to "Maximize Exam Security Using Remote Proctoring" &lt;a href="/pdf/examsoft_exammonitor.pdf"&gt;(link to brochure)&lt;/a&gt;.  ExamMonitor claims to ensure secure exam administrations without a consistent internet connection, and this is done through a &lt;strong&gt;continuous audio and video recording of the examinee during the test.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your laptop's webcam, ExamSoft's ExamMonitor will record the audio from your room, your face and your screen activity while you're taking the test. Following an upload of all of that data, ExamSoft will use automated analysis tools (likely applying machine learning) to assess a student's "gaze" throughout the exam, the presense of background noise, and a whole slew of unspecified other criteria. If the decision algorithm determines that there's a concern, the issue is flagged and brought in front administrators through ExamSoft's proctoring reports. As someone who tends to stare off into space while thinking through exam answers, the thought of my gaze being scrutinized and amounting to a risk to my character and fitness assessment is, to put it mildly, not ideal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In implementing this solution, every exam taker is effectively bringing their state's board of bar examiners into their homes, and will have to deal with the psychological impact of having any visual or audio background noise being flagged as a potential violation while they're taking the most important test of their lives. &lt;em&gt;Was that hammering from the upstairs neighbor, or was it morse code?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Did the test taker's mother barge into the room on purpose, or was it actually an accident&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Why is the test taker scratching his face&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Why does she keep looking at the wall?&lt;/em&gt; In a time where we are all already dealing with &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yolarobert1/2020/04/30/heres-why-youre-feeling-zoom-fatigue/#2c794bc72ac6"&gt;Zoom fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, the thought of being scrutinzied during the course of a two day exam is nauseating at best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, an online administration of the bar exam with these invasive controls (meant to curb cheating) amounts to a coerced intrusion into someone's private space. It's one thing for employers to demand the use of webcams to keep an eye on the people that they're paying, but it's an entirely different matter when you are forcing your future colleagues to pay for the privilege of letting you into their private spaces by giving them a choice between "let us watch, listen to, and scrutinize you at home" and " why don't you wait until 2021 in order to take in-person administration of the bar exam." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this exploration of circumstantial, technical, and privacy issues associated with a remote administration of the bar exam, I hope that I was able to raise a few eyebrows and promote a sense of caution as bar examiners decide the fates of the tens of thousands of lawyers-to-be that are eager to enter the profession, pay off their compounding debts, and make an impact during a time where &lt;a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/2020/07/08/boston-eviction-moratorium-august/"&gt;attorneys are needed more than ever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="law school"></category><category term="bar exam"></category><category term="law school"></category><category term="remote working"></category></entry><entry><title>A Student's Guide to 'Working From Home'</title><link href="/a-students-guide-to-working-from-home.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2020-03-12:/a-students-guide-to-working-from-home.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/wfh.png" class="img-responsive" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the WHO's recent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says"&gt;declaration&lt;/a&gt; of a pandemic and the litany of &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/10/nation/list-area-colleges-canceling-classes-sending-students-home-due-coronavirus/"&gt;school closures&lt;/a&gt; happening due to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, many law schools are shifting the rest of their classes this year to remote classes conducted through services like Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype, or WebEx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a former engineer who spent a lot of time working remotely, there are a few things that I've picked up from experience and from reading various productivity/business books that I think would be useful to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few days of working from home are, admittedly, pretty great. You get to wake up in your pajamas, pop your laptop open wherever you want (including from the warmth of your bed), and just lounge at your own pace. If you're like me, you'll also simultaneously realize that your productivity ends up taking a nosedive because your mindset hasn't switched over to 'work mode'. Here are some ways to flip the switch and get your brain going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put your damn pants on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to start with what is arguably the most controversial opinion - even if you are planning on working from home, you should ditch your PJs. Yes, they are comfortable, yes, no one is going to see you anyway, and yes, you'll end up having another pair of clothes to wash when you do laundry, but when you &lt;em&gt;wear&lt;/em&gt; clothes that you typically go to school in, you'll find yourself more amenable to working as opposed to lounging and watching netflix while your textbook is open in front of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set the stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our constantly connected "always on" world, I think we generally take the notion of environment for granted. That said, there's a reason why we consciously or subconsciously prefer &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; table in the student lounge, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; coffee shop around the corner, or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; group study room - it's because we are likely to gravitate to environments that we can explicitly classify as "work" places. When your at home, you can accomplish the same goal by designating your own "work" space where the only thing that you do in that space is &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. So if you have a kitchen table, dedicate one seat on table as your "work" table, or arrange the furniture in a specific way when you want to work. You could even go as far as pulling out your notebooks/book stands and arranging them when you're ready to get started, and then subsequently disassembling them when you're done for the day as a step to clear your mind. Create the environment that gets you into the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"&gt;flow state&lt;/a&gt;" faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get energized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuting often plays role additional to getting you where you need to be - it also helps you get in the right head space to take on the day. Whether you listen to music, read a book, put on a podcast, or exercise, it's important to &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; doing those things so that you can (to borrow a term from chemistry) build up enough &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy"&gt;activation energy&lt;/a&gt; to get working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Keeping things going&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you're on your way, here are a few ways to keep on track while the world continues around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Establish boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people think of working from home as the equivalent of having a day off, thus giving friends family, and roommates the opportunity to barge in when it's a nice day and say "hey, why don't you get off the computer and enjoy some sunshine with me!" Avoid this temptation entirely by establishing boundaries - it could be something as simple as saying "When I have my headphones on, please don't bother me" or as intricate as sharing a calendar with the people close to you to let them know that &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; are your work hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Routines and habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still have a class schedule, and you should thus build your own weekly schedules to accommodate all of the work that you need to do. By setting routines and maintaining a predictable rhythm, you get the dual benefits of knowing what you should be working on next and finding comfort in a semblance of structure so that you know when to shut down, enjoy the rest of your day, and stave off burnout without having a location change as a motivator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with the extra time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that by not commuting to and from school and shuffling between classes, you'll probably end up with a surplus of extra time. If you can, try to fill this time with stuff that you've had on your wishlist of things to do, whether it be learning how to cook new recipes, planning your post-outbreak vacation, or trying a new hobby - just take advantage of that time to treat yourself for being so focused at home. You could also use the time to just &lt;strong&gt;go outside&lt;/strong&gt; and get some fresh air to restore you for the next round of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Practical wisdom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types are by the far the most "mechanical", in that there are suggested tools, applications, or ideas to make your remote life a bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Batch your work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in front of your computer all day makes it really easy for you to have multiple windows open all the time. Instead of multitasking(which &lt;a href="https://hbrascend.org/topics/multitasking-doesnt-work/"&gt;doesn't work)&lt;/a&gt;, focus on things one thing at a time, and also batch your like tasks together. For example, if you have a bunch of e-mails to send out, arrange your to do list so that all your e-mails are stacked next to each other.  If you're looking for a flexible to-do list application, I like &lt;strong&gt;TodoIst:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist: The to do list to organize work &amp;amp; life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mute your microphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough - the default state of your microphone should be "mute" and the default state of your webcam should be "off". The last thing that you want to do is accidentally say something you shouldn't have said, so take advantage of features like Zoom's "Push to Talk" functionality where the mic is set to be muted by default. You also don't want your class an unexpected look into your living space - just hit the "video on" button when you're ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay in touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many remote conference tools offer easy ways to create your own conference rooms for "drop in" meetings, In Zoom, for example, you can see this in personal meeting links, as documented here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362843-What-is-Personal-Meeting-ID-PMI-and-Personal-Link-"&gt;Personal meeting ID (PMI) and personal link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great way to share a link with friends and have them drop in on a "study with me" session with you. Even if you and your friends are all on mute, having each other on a web cam can motivate you just a little bit longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduce some noise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of the most frustrating things about being at home is that things get &lt;em&gt;too quiet.&lt;/em&gt; If music isn't your thing, you could also try listening to some idle background noise - my favorite place for noise is this website, which allows you to mix and match multiple background noises to create a "noise mix" that works for you. Have you ever wondered what a windy coffee shop next to a waterfall sounds like? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://noises.online/"&gt;Online Background Noises * Relaxing Sounds * Noise Masking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Security, redundancy, reliability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integrity of your computer system is going to be more important now than it was when you were on campus, particularly since it will be harder for your school's IT teams to reach you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multi-factor authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling multi-factor authentication is a really easy way to add a layer of security on top of your most sensitive online accounts. If you're going to be accessing your school resources in public environments, a good multi-factor authentication solution is a lifesaver. Many schools already have MFA in the form of a solution like Duo, and you can enable your own 2FA across many of your accounts with an authentication management tool like Authy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://authy.com/"&gt;Authy | Two-factor Authentication (2FA) App &amp;amp; Guides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is generally good practice overall, but you should seriously consider using a password manager  that can help you generate unique (and more secure) passwords for all of your school logins (e-mail, Blackboard, zoom, etc.) as well as ensure that you'll have your login information secure in the event your computer goes down and you need to move to a new laptop or your parents' machine. I personally use 1Password, but there are many great alternatives out there, including the totally free to use Bitwarden. Also check with your school's IT department, as they might have a license to password manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://1password.com/"&gt;Password Manager for Families, Businesses, Teams | 1Password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Backup and cloud storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most schools give students access to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; type of cloud storage solution, whether it be box, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, or others. Take advantage of these solutions and store all of your notes, outlines, and scans in the cloud. If you use any of these solutions' native applications, you'll be able to work offline and sync online the next time you have access to the internet. You also get the extra added benefit of being able to share files with your peers easily or access your own files from any computer with an internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a law student participating in a clinic, you will likely be handling client sensitive documents so please CHECK WITH YOUR CLINIC SUPERVISOR before storing anything in a cloud folder. Your clinic will have policies governing the use of cloud storage for client documents.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a cloud storage solution, you might also want to invest in a "full system" backup solution that takes everything on your system and stores it securely. Your school might have a license to a solution like this, or you can leverage something like Backblaze or Carbonite. The big benefit for a solution like this is that you'll have complete access to both previously deleted files and previous versions of existing files - in case you need to revert back to an old draft! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;VPNs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are attending a university here in the states, there's a high chance that your school offers a VPN that allows students to connect to university resources while off campus. This is particularly useful if you're trying to do research on a paper topic and need access to a scientific or academic journal. VPNs also have the extra added benefit of securing your traffic so that you can feel safe while you're browsing and working from a coffee shop. Lastly, using a VPN allows you to access the web as if you were still on campus, a feature that is particularly useful in places that restrict access to certain websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
