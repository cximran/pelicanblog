                <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The necessary safety precautions necessitated by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) has drastically affected the day-to-day lives of the over 112 thousand law students currently enrolled at ABA-approved law schools <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#a586bfbc758c4df482b41bee4d895684">[1]</a>. </p>
<p>While this transition is disruptive on so many levels across the legal education system, the  inherent inequities associated with this sudden change require immediate attention and unprecedented action. One such action is to shift to a <strong>mandatory</strong> "Pass/Fail" grading system for all law students during their Spring semesters <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#26940e09a45847a383ae96ab8f71dae8">[2]</a>. </p>
<h2>A quick aside</h2>
<p>I fully recognize and appreciate that the very fact that I am <em>in</em> law school is an extraordinary privilege afforded to few, and that the "big picture" associated with this outbreak extends far beyond the concerns of law students, law schools, and the legal profession.  I also want to offer a disclaimer - I personally <em>prefer</em> working from home. I have an introverted personality and I really enjoy the work space and environment that my wife and I have set up in our home. That being said, I recognize that my circumstances are more the exception than the rule.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I also would like to note that these views are my own and they do not necessarily reflect the views of my school, the faculty that I've learned from and worked with, or my peers. </p>
<h1>Inequities of the "catastrophically online" law school</h1>
<p>The anonymous essay grading system and mandatory class curve at many schools serve an egalitarian purpose: to give every student an equal opportunity to learn the law and apply that law to facts. While there's certainly reasoned arguments in support of or against this grading system, those concerns pale in comparison to the fundamental inequity that arises out of our new temporary reality. </p>
<h2>Technical inequity</h2>
<p>The most apparent and straightforward dimension of inequity comes from the differing levels of technical equipment and comfort with shifting the sum total of one's educational experience into a screen no larger than their textbooks. </p>
<p>For example, let's take a laptop for the Class of 2021. A mid 2017 MacBook Air (released in June 2017 and was the latest MacBook Air model available to students starting in August 2018) came standard with a 1.8 GHz processor <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#5702c864c664461bb4a4de5245dd14aa">[3]</a>.  Zoom, a leading web conferencing software suite, <strong>recommends</strong> that users have at <em>least</em> a 2GHz processor <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#7bcc0cb45cdf4b37bbaecacf4fc4fe8b">[4]</a>. While Zoom's <em>minimum</em> requirements specify a 1GHz processor, the typical use case for a student in an online lecture requires that student to have multiple applications running concurrently in addition to their web conference tool, such as a word processor to review an outline, a note taking application to take class notes, and an e-textbook or PDF reader. </p>
<p>Students with lower-end devices are thus saddled with a user experience that just slows them down. Compare that "low end hardware" student to another student that has the resources to invest in a higher end computer, a widescreen monitor, an external full-size keyboard, and mouse. </p>
<p>The differences may not be apparent at first, but as hours and hours of online instruction add up (combined with hours and hours of reading), the advantage of a fast machine in an ergonomically sound configuration becomes more and more apparent. Companies like Google recognize the importance of hardware when working at home and have given employees work from home "kits" for employees that come standard with monitors, keyboards, and mice <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#dbda943d9ce344c89eb17513d57f24d7">[5]</a>. While I of course am not asking schools to offer the same amenities to students as a multibillion dollar corporation, I <em>am</em> asking that these schools consider the difference that the right set-up can make. </p>
<p>Another dimension of technical inequity comes in the form of access to broadband internet. While broadband penetration today is better than ever, the availability of and access to high speed internet that is capable of streaming full motion video and high quality audio is less certain, particularly given the current climate where local network providers are going to dealing with significant network congestion as a result of basically <em>every</em> knowledge worker working from home. I've seen it myself in a few classes already, where students have dropped in and out of classes due to local internet issues. </p>
<h2>Logistical inequity</h2>
<p>Beyond the technical issues, there are also remains the fundamental problem of <em>finding a quiet place to do work</em>. Law students have a close relationship to their libraries, often because of the fact that the library represents one of the few spaces in a student's life that is actually <em>quiet</em>. In a time where we're encouraged to practice social distancing in public settings, finding a place to sit quietly for hours on end (and, for that matter, occasionally interact with classmates and professors online) is <em>really hard</em>. Not every student has the benefits of a childhood bedroom or home office, particularly those students that come from lower income backgrounds or from families with multiple adult children now occupying the same space. </p>
<p>There's also the problem of accessing textbooks, research materials, and printers. There's a reason why my school gives law students a generous printing allowance - we use a <em>lot</em> of paper. The ability to thumb through books, outlines, and articles often helps us engage with the material and organize our work - something that might not be possible even <em>with</em> a high capacity printer at home because our kitchen tables can only function as "document dumps" for so long. </p>
<p>The final point about logistical inequity is a simple one: time. By moving classrooms to the home, law schools have foisted upon some students the responsibility for maintaining both their living <em>and</em> working spaces. This requires time - time to clean the space with more regularity, time to rearrange furniture between modes of use, and time to <em>get out</em> of the space in order to refresh our minds and bodies. </p>
<h2>Emotional inequity</h2>
<p>The last and in my opinion most troubling type of inequity comes from the different ways law students have had to bear the emotional weight of this pandemic. As these weeks roll on, law students across the country will deal with stresses arising out of differing levels of local outbreak containment efforts, economic impacts, and family tragedies. </p>
<p>While schools have made strides in identifying and mitigating sources of stress amongst law students, the unique recipe of career uncertainty, "all-or-nothing" grading, and looming financial obligations mixes into a sour blend that is already hard to swallow. This pandemic and the necessary mitigations associated with it have made what was once indigestible now absolutely toxic. </p>
<p>Among the "run of the mill" stresses weighing law students down, they now have to deal with: </p>
<ul>
<li>Physically isolating themselves from their friends and study groups and limiting social interaction to screens.</li>
<li>Completely upending established routines and methods of studying.</li>
<li>An uncertain economic future, particularly for those who will be leaving their schools at the end of the semester.</li>
<li>The ever-present threat that someone close to us will be fatally affected by the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, every student in these online schools of law will continue to be confronted by the press coverage of and social media reactions to the outbreak. It's absolutely inescapable, particularly when these channels often are the <em>only</em> mechanism that students have to participate in the world around them. A student's social networks are as diverse as they are, and there is frankly no way to predict or control what information is made available to them absent requiring students to completely disconnect from the outside world. </p>
<p>Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention the scores of students in clinics or externship programs that have been forced to abandon their clients as part of this transition. While advisors, mentors, and clinical attorneys of course will do everything in their power to maintain connections and continue representations, the lingering guilt of feeling that you <em>abandoned your client</em> can't be understated. </p>
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>With the above points in mind, I strongly suggest that law schools act in the best interests of current law students and adopt a mandatory "pass/fail" grading system and to announce that change to their student body as soon as possible. </p>
<h2>Why make it mandatory?</h2>
<p>Many schools have considered or implemented a system where students can <em>choose</em> to complete their semesters with traditional letter grades or with a pass/fail system. </p>
<p>I am against this for one simple reason: the stigma attached to a pass/fail credit when students have an option between pass/fail grading and letter grading. While I do not have a view into the legal hiring system beyond my own personal experiences, I do not think there is any doubt that grades matter and will <em>continue</em> to matter after this pandemic subsides. Accordingly, the first thought in any student's mind (particularly in those in the class of 2022) will be - how would this look on my transcript? Forcing a student to choose between the <em>possibility</em> of an "A" and the (almost) <em>certainty</em> of a "Pass" in a time like this adds yet another unnecessary layer of burdensome complexity in an already uncertain time. </p>
<h3>What about the students that have worked to improve their grades?</h3>
<p>This is the most common justification that I've seen for an optional pass/fail system. Students rightfully feel that they are entitled to an opportunity to improve their grades after underperforming, and a pass/fail system deprives those students of the opportunity to demonstrate upward momentum and thus make themselves more appealing to prospective employers. I regret that I don't have a clean solution for this, but I do have a few suggestions: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look at the data:</strong> I encourage law schools to go back through their grade histories and understand how many students have been able to boost their grades after underperforming. At a minimum, this will help better approximate the impact that this type of system would have. </li>
<li><strong>Split the schedule:</strong>  Given that grades represent a big concern for hiring season and OCI, law schools should work with hiring firms to "split" their hiring across the fall and spring semesters for 2020-2021 academic year. This way, students that performed well in their first semester can bid and interview with their best foot forward (as high performing students end up doing during their 1L spring after performing well during their 1L fall), and students that want an opportunity to improve can do so during their 2L/3L fall semesters. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Why not let the professors decide how they want to grade?</h2>
<p>While I do not doubt the capacity for compassion that professors have in a time like this, leaving the choice of grading in the hands of individual professors still creates uncertainty in the system and blunts the benefits associated with a clearly communicated, universal plan. Moreover, if we're trying to adapt against inequity, creating even more variability is <em>not</em> the best way forward. </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As part of their efforts to support employees during this pandemic, Facebook recently announced that they will be giving every single employee the same "exceeds expectations" performance review for the first half of the year, a fact that underscores the impact of this pandemic and the importance of setting new norms in times of crisis <a href="https://www.notion.so/imalek/In-support-of-Pass-Fail-Grading-for-Law-Students-who-have-transitioned-online-5760f82523f449578f776a150670b758#ff1dc0f700374472867ac95159a3f249">[6]</a>. </p>
<p>Among all of the lessons that this sprint from offline to online education will teach us in the coming weeks, one early insight comes through: leadership matters. The first schools to switch to online education set the standard for others to follow, and the law schools that recognize the changing times and adapt in the best interests of their students again have an opportunity to lead by example. </p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>With the WHO's recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says">declaration</a> of a pandemic and the litany of <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/10/nation/list-area-colleges-canceling-classes-sending-students-home-due-coronavirus/">school closures</a> happening due to <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen">COVID-19</a>, many law schools are shifting the rest of their classes this year to remote classes conducted through services like Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype, or WebEx. </p>
<p>As a former engineer who spent a lot of time working remotely, there are a few things that I've picked up from experience and from reading various productivity/business books that I think would be useful to share. </p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>The first few days of working from home are, admittedly, pretty great. You get to wake up in your pajamas, pop your laptop open wherever you want (including from the warmth of your bed), and just lounge at your own pace. If you're like me, you'll also simultaneously realize that your productivity ends up taking a nosedive because your mindset hasn't switched over to 'work mode'. Here are some ways to flip the switch and get your brain going. </p>
<h2>Put your damn pants on</h2>
<p>I'm going to start with what is arguably the most controversial opinion - even if you are planning on working from home, you should ditch your PJs. Yes, they are comfortable, yes, no one is going to see you anyway, and yes, you'll end up having another pair of clothes to wash when you do laundry, but when you <em>wear</em> clothes that you typically go to school in, you'll find yourself more amenable to working as opposed to lounging and watching netflix while your textbook is open in front of you. </p>
<h2>Set the stage</h2>
<p>In our constantly connected "always on" world, I think we generally take the notion of environment for granted. That said, there's a reason why we consciously or subconsciously prefer <em>that</em> table in the student lounge, <em>that</em> coffee shop around the corner, or <em>that</em> group study room - it's because we are likely to gravitate to environments that we can explicitly classify as "work" places. When your at home, you can accomplish the same goal by designating your own "work" space where the only thing that you do in that space is <em>work</em>. So if you have a kitchen table, dedicate one seat on table as your "work" table, or arrange the furniture in a specific way when you want to work. You could even go as far as pulling out your notebooks/book stands and arranging them when you're ready to get started, and then subsequently disassembling them when you're done for the day as a step to clear your mind. Create the environment that gets you into the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>" faster. </p>
<h2>Get energized</h2>
<p>Commuting often plays role additional to getting you where you need to be - it also helps you get in the right head space to take on the day. Whether you listen to music, read a book, put on a podcast, or exercise, it's important to <em>keep</em> doing those things so that you can (to borrow a term from chemistry) build up enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy">activation energy</a> to get working. </p>
<h1>Keeping things going</h1>
<p>Now that you're on your way, here are a few ways to keep on track while the world continues around you. </p>
<h2>Establish boundaries</h2>
<p>Many people think of working from home as the equivalent of having a day off, thus giving friends family, and roommates the opportunity to barge in when it's a nice day and say "hey, why don't you get off the computer and enjoy some sunshine with me!" Avoid this temptation entirely by establishing boundaries - it could be something as simple as saying "When I have my headphones on, please don't bother me" or as intricate as sharing a calendar with the people close to you to let them know that <em>these</em> are your work hours. </p>
<h2>Routines and habits</h2>
<p>You still have a class schedule, and you should thus build your own weekly schedules to accommodate all of the work that you need to do. By setting routines and maintaining a predictable rhythm, you get the dual benefits of knowing what you should be working on next and finding comfort in a semblance of structure so that you know when to shut down, enjoy the rest of your day, and stave off burnout without having a location change as a motivator. </p>
<h2>Dealing with the extra time</h2>
<p>You'll notice that by not commuting to and from school and shuffling between classes, you'll probably end up with a surplus of extra time. If you can, try to fill this time with stuff that you've had on your wishlist of things to do, whether it be learning how to cook new recipes, planning your post-outbreak vacation, or trying a new hobby - just take advantage of that time to treat yourself for being so focused at home. You could also use the time to just <strong>go outside</strong> and get some fresh air to restore you for the next round of work. </p>
<h1>Practical wisdom</h1>
<p>These types are by the far the most "mechanical", in that there are suggested tools, applications, or ideas to make your remote life a bit easier. </p>
<h2>Batch your work</h2>
<p>Being in front of your computer all day makes it really easy for you to have multiple windows open all the time. Instead of multitasking(which <a href="https://hbrascend.org/topics/multitasking-doesnt-work/">doesn't work)</a>, focus on things one thing at a time, and also batch your like tasks together. For example, if you have a bunch of e-mails to send out, arrange your to do list so that all your e-mails are stacked next to each other.  If you're looking for a flexible to-do list application, I like <strong>TodoIst:</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.todoist.com/">Todoist: The to do list to organize work &amp; life</a></p>
<h2>Mute your microphone</h2>
<p>I cannot stress this enough - the default state of your microphone should be "mute" and the default state of your webcam should be "off". The last thing that you want to do is accidentally say something you shouldn't have said, so take advantage of features like Zoom's "Push to Talk" functionality where the mic is set to be muted by default. You also don't want your class an unexpected look into your living space - just hit the "video on" button when you're ready. </p>
<h2>Stay in touch</h2>
<p>Many remote conference tools offer easy ways to create your own conference rooms for "drop in" meetings, In Zoom, for example, you can see this in personal meeting links, as documented here: </p>
<p><a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362843-What-is-Personal-Meeting-ID-PMI-and-Personal-Link-">Personal meeting ID (PMI) and personal link</a></p>
<p>This is a really great way to share a link with friends and have them drop in on a "study with me" session with you. Even if you and your friends are all on mute, having each other on a web cam can motivate you just a little bit longer. </p>
<h2>Introduce some noise</h2>
<p>Sometimes one of the most frustrating things about being at home is that things get <em>too quiet.</em> If music isn't your thing, you could also try listening to some idle background noise - my favorite place for noise is this website, which allows you to mix and match multiple background noises to create a "noise mix" that works for you. Have you ever wondered what a windy coffee shop next to a waterfall sounds like? </p>
<p><a href="https://noises.online/">Online Background Noises * Relaxing Sounds * Noise Masking</a></p>
<h1>Security, redundancy, reliability</h1>
<p>The integrity of your computer system is going to be more important now than it was when you were on campus, particularly since it will be harder for your school's IT teams to reach you. </p>
<h2>Multi-factor authentication</h2>
<p>Enabling multi-factor authentication is a really easy way to add a layer of security on top of your most sensitive online accounts. If you're going to be accessing your school resources in public environments, a good multi-factor authentication solution is a lifesaver. Many schools already have MFA in the form of a solution like Duo, and you can enable your own 2FA across many of your accounts with an authentication management tool like Authy. </p>
<p><a href="https://authy.com/">Authy | Two-factor Authentication (2FA) App &amp; Guides</a></p>
<h2>Password management</h2>
<p>This is generally good practice overall, but you should seriously consider using a password manager  that can help you generate unique (and more secure) passwords for all of your school logins (e-mail, Blackboard, zoom, etc.) as well as ensure that you'll have your login information secure in the event your computer goes down and you need to move to a new laptop or your parents' machine. I personally use 1Password, but there are many great alternatives out there, including the totally free to use Bitwarden. Also check with your school's IT department, as they might have a license to password manager. </p>
<p><a href="https://1password.com/">Password Manager for Families, Businesses, Teams | 1Password</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Open Source Password Management Solutions | Bitwarden</a></p>
<h2>Backup and cloud storage</h2>
<p>Most schools give students access to <em>some</em> type of cloud storage solution, whether it be box, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, or others. Take advantage of these solutions and store all of your notes, outlines, and scans in the cloud. If you use any of these solutions' native applications, you'll be able to work offline and sync online the next time you have access to the internet. You also get the extra added benefit of being able to share files with your peers easily or access your own files from any computer with an internet connection. </p>
<p><strong>If you are a law student participating in a clinic, you will likely be handling client sensitive documents so please CHECK WITH YOUR CLINIC SUPERVISOR before storing anything in a cloud folder. Your clinic will have policies governing the use of cloud storage for client documents.</strong> </p>
<p>In addition to a cloud storage solution, you might also want to invest in a "full system" backup solution that takes everything on your system and stores it securely. Your school might have a license to a solution like this, or you can leverage something like Backblaze or Carbonite. The big benefit for a solution like this is that you'll have complete access to both previously deleted files and previous versions of existing files - in case you need to revert back to an old draft! </p>

<h2>VPNs</h2>
<p>If you are attending a university here in the states, there's a high chance that your school offers a VPN that allows students to connect to university resources while off campus. This is particularly useful if you're trying to do research on a paper topic and need access to a scientific or academic journal. VPNs also have the extra added benefit of securing your traffic so that you can feel safe while you're browsing and working from a coffee shop. Lastly, using a VPN allows you to access the web as if you were still on campus, a feature that is particularly useful in places that restrict access to certain websites. </p>
